# Lunchables (WIP)

[Website](https://6notes.github.io/lunchables/)

## Description

Story that I will be using to demonstrate some features. I want to explore:

- [x] css/UI changes/background images
- [ ] inventory
- [ ] item gates
- [ ] randomly generated content

## Local testing

Run `mkdir -p ./dist && tweego -o ./dist/index.html ./passages`.

## Displaying images

- Image displays locally but doesn't work on GitHub Pages.
- [HiEv's Twine 2 / SugarCube 2 Sample Code guide](https://qjzhvmqlzvoo5lqnrvuhmg.on.drv.tw/UInv/Sample_Code.html#Main%20Menu)
  has a page on
  [displaying images in Twine](https://qjzhvmqlzvoo5lqnrvuhmg.on.drv.tw/UInv/Sample_Code.html#Displaying%20Images%20in%20Twine),
  however I don't want to manually add JS to the html every time.
